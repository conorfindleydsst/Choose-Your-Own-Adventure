    <p>You continue to run, but you twist you ankle. You get up and struggle to walk until you find the road. You look for somebody to pick you up. You stand outside for hours, until finally, you see somebody slow down. You get in the car and thank them and explain your story. Then you look over and see that you just got in the psycho killer's car.</p>
